# AstarGraphSearch<h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Project implements a Graph ADT using an adjacency map and includes core graph search functionality. The solution supports breadth-first search (BFS) for unweighted-style traversal, A* search using either Euclidean or Taxicab distance as an admissible heuristic, and an application problem ("teleport") that finds the shortest path across multiple galaxy graphs using wormhole-style teleportation between systems. The implementation follows required time/space complexity constraints and uses efficient queue/priority queue structures to avoid O(N^2) path reconstruction.
